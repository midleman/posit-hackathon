# posit-hackathon

## Purpose

This project is designed to help you retrieve, analyze, and compare test results across multiple runs using the Currents.dev API. It provides actionable insights based on the success, failure, and resolution of tests over time. Specifically, it focuses on categorizing tests into the following groups:

- **New Failures**: Tests that failed for the first time in the current run.
- **Still Failing**: Tests that have failed in both the previous and current runs.
- **Resolved**: Tests that were previously failing but have passed in the current run.
- **New Tests**: Tests that were added in the current run.

## Installation

Get started with a few quick steps:

1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/posit-dev/posit-hackathon.git

# ensure you have `python` and `pip` installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Add `.env` to root dir

```text
CURRENTS_API_KEY=your_api_key <--- ask Marie for one if you need one!
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID=ZOs5z2
FILTER_BRANCHES=main,ref/heads/main
FILTER_TAGS=merge
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Runs for the Currents Project**: The script retrieves the most recent test runs based on the project ID and filters them by the "merge" tag.
2. **Retrieving Test Results**: Test results for each run are fetched from the Currents.dev API.
3. **Generating the Test Diff**: A diff is generated by comparing the results from the previous and current runs. This diff categorizes tests as "New Failures," "Still Failing," and "Resolved."
4. **Detailed Analysis**: The analysis includes detailed insights about each test, including its status, consecutive failures, and overall trend.

## Examples

### A previously failing test is now passing

If a test that was previously failing has now passed in the most recent run, it will be categorized under "Resolved." Here's an example:

```markdown
🫠 Still Failing (1)
[e2e-electron] New UV Environment > Python - Add new UV environment (3x since abc1234)

🔴 New Failure (1)
[e2e-electron] Notebooks > Python Notebooks > Python - Save untitled notebook and preserve... — Timeout waiting for invisibility

⭐️ New Tests (3):
[e2e-browser] Console Pane: R > R - Verify cat ... (added by Marie Idleman)
[e2e-windows] Console Pane: R > R - Verify cat ... (added by Marie Idleman)
[e2e-electron] Console Pane: R > R - Verify cat ... (added by Marie Idleman)

✅ Resolved (1):
[Interpreter: Excludes] R - Can Exclude an Interpreter
```
